## Introduction

This is a fork from ucore_os with adding a docker support. For more details about how to build the develop environment, see [this doc](./docs/README.md).

The docker image use Ubuntu 16.04, and use `config/sources.list` for configuring ubuntu sources. If you don't want  to use this sources list, you can change it to your own version.
